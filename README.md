Using the dataset Chest X-Ray Images , I use CNN (using TensorFlow) to classify X rays of lungs in 2 categories :
 - patients with normal lungs
 - patients who suffer of pneumonia

I am interesting in the altruistic use of data science in the medical field and I wanted to use my Computer Vision , indeed those are the 2 reasons of the origin of this project.

---------- THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS ------------------------
